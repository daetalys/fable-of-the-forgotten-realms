Dark Knights are formidable warriors who harness forbidden powers to enhance their combat abilities. Often seen in menacing armor, they use a combination of heavy weaponry and dark magic to overwhelm their enemies. Dark Knights are not afraid to wield spells that drain life, invoke fear, or manipulate shadows. Their willingness to tap into darker forces makes them unpredictable and dangerous opponents.
